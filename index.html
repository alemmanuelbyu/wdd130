            <p>Hello, Hello, my name is Emmanuel Olusola Irebami, and I am from Nigeria. As the eldest of three children, I have always felt a sense of responsibility to set a good example for my siblings and make my family proud. Growing up in Nigeria taught me valuable lessons about resilience, hard work, and the importance of team work. My academic journey has been a rewarding one. Before becoming an online student at Brigham Young University-Idaho (BYU-Idaho), I was part of the BYU Pathway Worldwide program, which has not only deepened my faith but also provided me with a solid foundation in academic and professional skills. I am currently pursuing studies in web and computer programming at BYU-Idaho. This field fascinates me because of its constant evolution and the endless possibilities it offers. My goal is to develop a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. I aim to complete my degree within the next few years and build a portfolio of projects that showcase my skills. I envision myself becoming a skilled software developer, capable of designing and developing innovative solutions to real-world problems. I hope to work for a reputable tech company or start my own business, creating jobs and opportunities for others. Ultimately, I aspire to use my skills to make a positive impact in my community and beyond. In my free time, I enjoy reading and playing soccer with friends.</p>
